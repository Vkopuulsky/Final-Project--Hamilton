										<h1>Aaron Burr</h1>

									<p>Aaron Burr was an American politician and served as vice president of the United States during President Thomas Jefferson's first term(1801-1805). He also served as the Continental Army officer in the Revolutionary War. Burr was also a lawyer and elected to the New York Assembly. He was married to Eliza Jumel. His only child was his daughter, Theodosia Burr Alston, named after her mother Theodosia Bartow Prevost.</p>

                                        <P>Aaron Burr was born in Newark, New Jersey, on February 6, 1756, to a long line of English gentry who had been active in politics. Burr's father was a Presbyterian minister and the president of the College of New Jersey. After the loss of both of his parents, Burr and his sister went to live with their wealthy maternal uncle.

</p>
									<p>As a revolutionary soldier, Burr joined Benedict Arnold's men in their expedition to Quebec. By the spring of 1776, Burr had achieved the rank of major, and was appointed to serve under George Washington at his home in New York. He eventually transferred to the staff of General Israel Putnam, under whom he fulfilled an array of posts until he retired from his commission in 1779.</p>
									<p>In June 1774, the Massachusetts legislature issued a call for all of the colonies to meet at Philadelphia to consider these problems. But Royal Governor Josiah Martin refused to call a meeting of North Carolina's legislature in time to select delegates to go to Philadelphia. So the colony's Whigs (those who favored independence) formed a provincial congress that sent representatives to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in September.</p>
									
                                    <p>Admitting defeat, in 1812, Burr returned to the United States. Utterly broke, he attempted to rebuild his law practice in New York with moderate success. By 1830, he had grown dependent on his friends' financial support. Three years later, Burr married a wealthy widow, Eliza Jumel, but the marriage didn't last. Following the divorce, Burr suffered multiple strokes that left him partially paralyzed. He died under the care of his cousin on September 14, 1836, in the city of Port Richmond on Staten Island, New York.</p>
